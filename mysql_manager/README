MySQL Manager is a big project for creating an automatic application wizard.

Simply connect MySQL Manager to your existing database and you will have
a perfectly running web application to manage it.

MySQL Manager is very different from phpMyAdmin, because phpMyAdmin has been
created primarily to view and modify the database structure, mysql_manager
instead is done to allow developers have an application to use to insert
data into the database without having to write a line of code!
In a far (we hope not so much :)) future we hope that MySQL Manager could
become an alternative to Microsoft Access, for the ease of use and the power
of developing we applications without programming knowledge.

MySQL Manager understands relations between tables, so you will automagically
see combo box where a field is relationated to another and so on.

MySQL Manager will let you modify your web application with a simple
POINT AND CLICK graphic interface. Click on "EDIT" menu item and start
playing around. All modifies are saved to XML files.

MySQL Manager EDIT system may work only on Mozilla browsers.

MySQL Manager, as p4a, has a big PEAR integration, so primary keys are managed
trought sequences. You sould have no AUTOINCREMENT primary keys in your table
structure, simple INTEGER fields will correctly work.
